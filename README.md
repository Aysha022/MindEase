### The Problem Statement
Mental health is a crucial aspect of student life, yet it often remains neglected due to stigma, lack of awareness, and limited access to mental health support. Many students struggle with stress, anxiety, and academic pressure but hesitate to seek professional help. Our college lacks a dedicated platform for students to express their concerns, access mental health resources, and seek guidance from counselors in an easy and anonymous way.

### The Solution
Our Mental Well-Being Web App is designed to support students' mental health by providing a platform for easy access to college counselors, forming peer support groups, offering stress-relief games, and delivering daily motivational tips and quotes. 

### Implementation
For Software : 
The implementation of this project involves combining Flask, DeepFace, and the Spotify API to create a seamless experience where a user's emotions, detected from an image, are linked to a Spotify song recommendation.

1. **Flask Backend**
Purpose: Acts as the backbone of the application, handling routes, API requests, and user sessions.
The homepage (/) serves a web interface built using HTML, where users can interact with the app.

2.**Emotion Analysis with DeepFace**
Users upload an image via the /analyze route.
The image is temporarily saved and analyzed using the DeepFace library to determine the dominant emotion.

3.**Spotify API Integration**
Spotify OAuth is used for secure authentication, ensuring user data is accessed appropriately.
Once authenticated, the app fetches song recommendations based on the detected emotion.
A mapping between emotions and genres (e.g., happy ‚Üí pop, dance) ensures genre-appropriate song selections.
The Spotify API searches for tracks within these genres and returns the most relevant song.

4.**Dynamic Interaction**
Users interact with the app by uploading images.
Upon analysis, the app dynamically provides both the detected emotion and a Spotify song recommendation.
Results include the song name and a clickable Spotify link for immediate access.
