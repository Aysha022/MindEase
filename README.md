### The Problem Statement
Mental health is a crucial aspect of student life, yet it often remains neglected due to stigma, lack of awareness, and limited access to mental health support. Many students struggle with stress, anxiety, and academic pressure but hesitate to seek professional help. Our college lacks a dedicated platform for students to express their concerns, access mental health resources, and seek guidance from counselors in an easy and anonymous way.

### The Solution
Our Mental Well-Being Web App is designed to support students' mental health by providing a platform for easy access to college counselors, forming peer support groups, offering stress-relief games, and delivering daily motivational tips and quotes.
